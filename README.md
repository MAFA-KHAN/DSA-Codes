## 🚀 Overview
This repo is a curated collection of core **Data Structures & Algorithms** implemented from scratch.  
Every line is simple, readable, and meant to help you grow your fundamentals fast.

## 📚 What’s Inside

### 🔗 **Linked Lists**
- ✔️ Singly Linked List (full operations)  
- ✔️ Doubly Linked List (full operations)  
- ✔️ Circular Linked List (full operations)

### 📦 **Array-Based Implementations**
- ✔️ Array operations (insert, delete, update, search, etc.)  
- ✔️ Matrix operations (creation + traversal + manipulation)  
- ✔️ List implementation using arrays

### 🧱 **Stacks**
- ✔️ Stack using Array  
- ✔️ Stack using Linked List

## 🎯 Purpose
A clean playground to understand DSA the right way —  
from the bottom, with intention, clarity, and zero shortcuts.
